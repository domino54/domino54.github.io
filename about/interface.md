# New interface
Clean, easy and powerful. The game's interface has been greatly improved by adding new features, as well as setting the brand new, clear and modern look, designed to make it easier for newcomers to discover how does the game work.

### Gauges
Most important part of the ShootMania interface has been tweaked for a cleaner look, fitting new design standards defined by modern first person shooters. Better arrangement of the gauges and self-explanatory description can help new players to find themselves in ShootMania. Stamina has been relocated to the bottom center, hidden when full to make the interface more clean. The armor gauge is now located far over the left edge, while ammunition is present on the opposite side. Armor bar is also describing on what type of block the player is currently standing on. Some options allowing to change the interface's behavior are available in the main menu's **Settings** tab.

### Minimap
The minimap seen in top left corner of the screen is displaying the most important stuff happening near the player. Player is able to find primary objectives of the currently played mode on the minimap. Other players and bots can be seen as colorful dots (opponents are not visible on matchmaking servers). Locations of the weapons items are also revealed. Minimap can be toggled on/off at any time, with a press of the `N` button. In addition, multiple options for customizing the map appearance can be found in main menu's **Settings** tab.
**Note:** Minimap is not used in Invasion, due high CPU usage.

### Crosshair
New scripted crosshair is not only smaller, cleaner and more compact, but also shows a gauge telling the player exactly how much time is left until the currently used weapon will have at least one slot loaded. You can switch back to default crosshair at any time, with a press of `B` key.
